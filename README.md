# Movie List
Movie List is a website where users each have their own list of movies they have watched. They can specify the date they watched a certain movie and also give it a rating.
In addition, users can add new movies to the database, which have to be approved by an admin before appearing on the site.

##### Things still to be added:
* Users being able to edit movies added to their list (change rating, date watched)
* Each user having a friends list and adding other users to it
* Seeing other users' movie lists
* Ability to upload a movie cover when adding a new movie to the database. (with possible automatic cover finding)
* Showing average rating of each movie, calculated based on ratings given by users who have watched said movie
* Web API
* __Unit testing__
